🖼️ Image Captioning Using Deep Learning
This project demonstrates an image captioning system that uses deep learning to generate textual descriptions for images. The model is trained to understand image content and describe it in natural language.

📁 Project Structure
Image_Captioning_Training.ipynb
Contains the full pipeline for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and training.

Image_Captioning_Testing.ipynb
Used for loading the trained model and generating captions for new images.

🧠 Model Overview
The model architecture combines:

CNN (e.g., InceptionV3/ResNet) for extracting image features

RNN (e.g., LSTM) or Transformer for generating captions

📊 Dataset
We used a labeled dataset like MS COCO or Flickr8k, which contains thousands of images with corresponding human-written captions.

🚀 How to Run
Open Image_Captioning_Training.ipynb to train the model.

After training, run Image_Captioning_Testing.ipynb to test the model on new images.

🔧 Requirements
Python 3.x

TensorFlow / PyTorch

NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
